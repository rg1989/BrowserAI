# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive integration that connects the existing page context monitoring system with the AI chat interface, enabling contextual AI conversations based on real-time page data. The system will support both browser-based LLMs as a fallback and user-configurable AI models, allowing users to ask questions about their current browsing context and receive intelligent responses.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI chat interface to automatically use my current page context, so that I can ask questions about what I'm viewing without having to explain the context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the AI chat interface THEN the system SHALL automatically include current page context in AI requests
2. WHEN I ask "What is this page about?" THEN the AI SHALL respond based on the actual page content, structure, and metadata
3. WHEN I ask about specific elements on the page THEN the AI SHALL reference visible content, forms, tables, and interactive elements
4. WHEN the page content changes while chatting THEN the AI SHALL use the updated context for subsequent messages
5. WHEN I switch tabs during a conversation THEN the AI context SHALL automatically switch to the new tab's content

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to understand recent network activity on the page, so that I can get help with API calls, data flows, and debugging network issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask about recent API calls THEN the AI SHALL have access to captured network requests and responses
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the AI SHALL be able to help diagnose issues using actual request/response data
3. WHEN I ask "What data is this page loading?" THEN the AI SHALL reference actual network activity and API endpoints
4. WHEN debugging network issues THEN the AI SHALL provide insights based on captured HTTP status codes, headers, and payloads
5. WHEN privacy controls are enabled THEN the AI SHALL respect domain exclusions and data redaction settings

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a browser-based LLM as a fallback option, so that I can use the contextual AI features without requiring external API keys or internet connectivity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no external AI service is configured THEN the system SHALL automatically use a browser-based LLM
2. WHEN the browser-based LLM is active THEN it SHALL run locally using WebGPU or WebAssembly
3. WHEN using the browser LLM THEN the system SHALL provide reasonable response quality for contextual questions
4. WHEN the browser LLM fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options
5. WHEN switching between AI services THEN the transition SHALL be seamless without losing conversation context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure my own AI model and API key, so that I can use my preferred AI service with better performance and capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing AI settings THEN I SHALL be able to select from multiple AI service providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, local models)
2. WHEN configuring an AI service THEN I SHALL be able to enter my API key, select models, and adjust parameters
3. WHEN saving AI configuration THEN the settings SHALL be stored securely and persist across browser sessions
4. WHEN my API key is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL fall back to the browser-based LLM automatically
5. WHEN testing AI configuration THEN I SHALL be able to send a test message to verify the setup works

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want contextual AI suggestions and proactive insights, so that I can get help with common tasks and patterns on the current page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI detects forms on the page THEN it SHALL offer to help with form completion or validation
2. WHEN API errors are detected THEN the AI SHALL proactively suggest debugging steps
3. WHEN the page contains data tables THEN the AI SHALL offer to help analyze or extract data
4. WHEN common web development patterns are detected THEN the AI SHALL provide relevant suggestions
5. WHEN the user is on specific types of pages (e-commerce, documentation, etc.) THEN the AI SHALL offer contextually relevant assistance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the contextual AI system to work with the existing monitoring infrastructure, so that all the built monitoring components are utilized effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI system initializes THEN it SHALL integrate with the existing PageContextMonitor, NetworkMonitor, and DOMObserver
2. WHEN context data is collected THEN it SHALL be formatted appropriately for AI consumption
3. WHEN the monitoring system is disabled THEN the AI SHALL fall back to basic page content without advanced context
4. WHEN privacy controls are active THEN the AI SHALL respect all monitoring privacy settings
5. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the contextual features SHALL degrade gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want a settings interface for managing AI configuration and contextual features, so that I can control how the AI uses my browsing data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing extension settings THEN I SHALL see options for AI service configuration and contextual features
2. WHEN configuring contextual AI THEN I SHALL be able to enable/disable different types of context (network, DOM, content)
3. WHEN setting up AI services THEN I SHALL have options for model selection, temperature, and other parameters
4. WHEN managing privacy THEN I SHALL be able to exclude specific domains or data types from AI context
5. WHEN exporting settings THEN I SHALL be able to backup and restore my AI and privacy configurations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to provide intelligent responses about my browsing context, so that I can get meaningful help with web-based tasks and content analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask "Summarize this page" THEN the AI SHALL provide a comprehensive summary using actual page content and structure
2. WHEN I ask about specific elements THEN the AI SHALL reference actual DOM elements, forms, and interactive components
3. WHEN I ask about data on the page THEN the AI SHALL analyze tables, lists, and structured content
4. WHEN I ask about recent activity THEN the AI SHALL reference actual network requests, user interactions, and page changes
5. WHEN I ask for help with tasks THEN the AI SHALL provide actionable suggestions based on the current page context

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want the browser-based LLM to be lightweight and performant, so that it doesn't impact my browsing experience while providing useful contextual assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the browser LLM loads THEN it SHALL not cause noticeable performance degradation
2. WHEN processing contextual requests THEN the browser LLM SHALL respond within reasonable time limits (under 10 seconds)
3. WHEN memory usage is high THEN the system SHALL implement efficient model management and cleanup
4. WHEN the browser LLM is running THEN it SHALL not interfere with other browser functionality
5. WHEN switching tabs or closing the extension THEN the browser LLM SHALL properly release resources

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms, so that the contextual AI system is robust and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN external AI services fail THEN the system SHALL automatically fall back to the browser-based LLM
2. WHEN the browser LLM fails to load THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and alternative options
3. WHEN context collection fails THEN the AI SHALL continue to work with available data
4. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL handle offline scenarios gracefully
5. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide helpful error messages and recovery options
