# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds support for external AI API integration by allowing users to configure API keys for services like OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI providers. This replaces the current browser-based model loading approach with a more practical and professional solution that provides better performance, privacy, and reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure API keys for external AI services, so that I can use professional AI models without browser limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens settings THEN the system SHALL display an API configuration section
2. WHEN the user enters an API key THEN the system SHALL securely store it using Chrome extension storage
3. WHEN the user selects an AI provider THEN the system SHALL validate the provider is supported
4. IF an API key is configured THEN the system SHALL use the external API instead of browser models
5. WHEN the user saves API settings THEN the system SHALL encrypt the API key before storage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to choose from multiple AI providers, so that I can use my preferred AI service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens API settings THEN the system SHALL display supported providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
2. WHEN the user selects a provider THEN the system SHALL show provider-specific configuration options
3. WHEN the user enters provider credentials THEN the system SHALL validate the format
4. IF multiple providers are configured THEN the system SHALL allow selecting a default provider
5. WHEN switching providers THEN the system SHALL maintain separate API key storage for each

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my API keys stored securely, so that my credentials are protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API key is entered THEN the system SHALL encrypt it before storage
2. WHEN the extension starts THEN the system SHALL decrypt API keys only when needed
3. WHEN the user logs out or clears data THEN the system SHALL securely delete stored keys
4. IF the extension is uninstalled THEN the system SHALL ensure all stored keys are removed
5. WHEN transmitting to APIs THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS only

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to test my API connection, so that I can verify my configuration works.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks "Test Connection" THEN the system SHALL make a test API call
2. IF the test succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a success message with model info
3. IF the test fails THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message
4. WHEN testing THEN the system SHALL show loading state during the request
5. IF rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL display appropriate guidance

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat interface to use my configured AI service, so that I get responses from my chosen model.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API key is configured THEN the chat interface SHALL use the external API
2. WHEN no API key is configured THEN the system SHALL display setup instructions
3. WHEN context is enabled THEN the system SHALL include page context in API requests
4. IF the API request fails THEN the system SHALL display an error and suggest fallback options
5. WHEN the API responds THEN the system SHALL display the response in the chat interface

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between available models in the chat interface, so that I can choose the best model for my task.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the chat interface loads THEN the system SHALL display a model selector dropdown
2. WHEN the user clicks the model selector THEN the system SHALL show all available models from configured providers
3. WHEN the user selects a different model THEN the system SHALL update the active model for subsequent messages
4. IF no models are available THEN the system SHALL display setup instructions
5. WHEN switching models THEN the system SHALL preserve the current conversation history

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to detect my intent, so that I'm guided to the appropriate mode for my request.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user sends a message THEN the system SHALL analyze the intent without context first
2. IF the intent is informational THEN the system SHALL process the request in current chat mode
3. IF the intent is actionable THEN the system SHALL prompt the user to switch to AI Agent mode
4. WHEN prompting for mode switch THEN the system SHALL display a clear explanation and action button
5. IF the user is already in AI Agent mode THEN the system SHALL process actionable requests directly

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to seamlessly transition to AI Agent mode when needed, so that I can perform actions without losing context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system detects an action intent THEN the system SHALL display "Switch to AI Agent" button
2. WHEN the user clicks the switch button THEN the system SHALL transfer the current question and context to AI Agent mode
3. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL preserve the original user message
4. IF context is enabled THEN the system SHALL include page context in the AI Agent request
5. WHEN in AI Agent mode THEN the system SHALL allow the AI to process requests with full context and capabilities

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my API usage and costs, so that I can control my spending.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN making API calls THEN the system SHALL track token usage locally
2. WHEN the user opens settings THEN the system SHALL display usage statistics
3. IF usage exceeds a threshold THEN the system SHALL warn the user
4. WHEN the user sets usage limits THEN the system SHALL respect those limits
5. WHEN limits are reached THEN the system SHALL pause API calls and notify the user
