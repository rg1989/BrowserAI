# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Spotlight Browser Extension codebase currently has 93 TypeScript compilation errors across 9 files that prevent successful builds and compromise code quality. These errors include type mismatches, duplicate function implementations, missing properties, and improper error handling. This feature aims to systematically resolve all TypeScript errors while maintaining existing functionality and improving code reliability.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all TypeScript compilation errors resolved, so that the codebase builds successfully and maintains type safety.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running `npx tsc --noEmit` THEN the system SHALL return zero compilation errors
2. WHEN building the extension THEN the system SHALL complete without TypeScript errors
3. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing functionality

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling with correct type annotations, so that runtime errors are properly typed and handled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN catching errors THEN the system SHALL properly type error objects as Error or unknown
2. WHEN accessing error properties THEN the system SHALL use type guards or type assertions
3. WHEN throwing errors THEN the system SHALL maintain proper error message formatting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want duplicate function implementations removed, so that the code is clean and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining class methods THEN the system SHALL have only one implementation per method
2. WHEN removing duplicates THEN the system SHALL preserve the most complete implementation
3. WHEN consolidating code THEN the system SHALL maintain all required functionality##
# Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper type definitions for all interfaces and classes, so that the code is self-documenting and type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining object types THEN the system SHALL include all required properties
2. WHEN using optional parameters THEN the system SHALL handle undefined values properly
3. WHEN working with external APIs THEN the system SHALL use proper type guards

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent method signatures across the codebase, so that function calls match their definitions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN calling methods THEN the system SHALL provide all required parameters
2. WHEN using optional parameters THEN the system SHALL handle them correctly
3. WHEN overriding methods THEN the system SHALL maintain compatible signatures

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper handling of Chrome extension APIs, so that browser integration works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using chrome.tabs API THEN the system SHALL handle undefined tab IDs properly
2. WHEN sending messages THEN the system SHALL use proper promise handling
3. WHEN accessing browser APIs THEN the system SHALL include proper error handling
