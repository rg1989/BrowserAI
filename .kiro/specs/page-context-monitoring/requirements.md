# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive page monitoring and context awareness system for the Spotlight Browser Extension. The system will monitor network activity (especially API calls), track page layout and content changes, and provide contextual information to AI chat interfaces. The system should work universally on any website while offering enhanced performance and capabilities for websites that follow specific plugin guidelines.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI chat to understand the current page context, so that I can ask questions about what I'm currently viewing without having to explain the context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the AI chat interface THEN the system SHALL have access to current page content and structure
2. WHEN the user asks questions about the current page THEN the AI SHALL be able to reference visible elements, text content, and page structure
3. WHEN the page content changes THEN the system SHALL update the context information automatically
4. WHEN multiple tabs are open THEN the system SHALL maintain separate context for each tab
5. WHEN the user switches tabs THEN the AI context SHALL switch to the active tab's context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to monitor and record API calls made by the current page, so that the AI can help me understand data flows and API interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page makes HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL capture request details (URL, method, headers, payload)
2. WHEN API responses are received THEN the system SHALL capture response data (status, headers, body)
3. WHEN the user asks about recent API activity THEN the AI SHALL have access to captured network data
4. WHEN API calls contain sensitive data THEN the system SHALL provide privacy controls to exclude certain domains or patterns
5. WHEN the monitoring buffer is full THEN the system SHALL implement a rolling window to maintain recent activity

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want websites to be able to provide enhanced context through plugin-specific guidelines, so that the monitoring system can work more efficiently and provide richer information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a website implements plugin guidelines THEN the system SHALL detect and utilize enhanced context APIs
2. WHEN enhanced context is available THEN the system SHALL prefer structured data over DOM parsing
3. WHEN websites provide semantic annotations THEN the system SHALL extract and utilize this metadata
4. WHEN plugin guidelines are followed THEN the system SHALL achieve better performance and accuracy
5. WHEN no plugin guidelines are present THEN the system SHALL fall back to universal monitoring methods

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to track page layout and visual changes, so that the AI can understand dynamic content and user interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN DOM elements are added, removed, or modified THEN the system SHALL detect and record these changes
2. WHEN the user interacts with page elements THEN the system SHALL track interaction context
3. WHEN forms are filled or submitted THEN the system SHALL capture form context (without sensitive data)
4. WHEN modal dialogs or overlays appear THEN the system SHALL update the current context
5. WHEN the page scrolls THEN the system SHALL track viewport changes and visible content

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want privacy controls for the monitoring system, so that I can control what information is captured and shared with AI.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the extension THEN the user SHALL be able to enable/disable different monitoring features
2. WHEN setting up monitoring THEN the user SHALL be able to exclude specific domains or URL patterns
3. WHEN sensitive data is detected THEN the system SHALL provide options to redact or exclude it
4. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the user SHALL have a clear indicator of what data is being captured
5. WHEN the user requests it THEN the system SHALL provide a way to clear captured data

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the monitoring system to be performant and non-intrusive, so that it doesn't negatively impact the browsing experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring is active THEN the system SHALL not cause noticeable performance degradation
2. WHEN capturing network data THEN the system SHALL use efficient interception methods
3. WHEN processing DOM changes THEN the system SHALL use optimized observation techniques
4. WHEN storing context data THEN the system SHALL implement efficient memory management
5. WHEN the monitoring load is high THEN the system SHALL implement throttling and prioritization

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to provide contextual suggestions and insights based on the current page, so that I can get proactive assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the AI detects common patterns THEN the system SHALL offer relevant suggestions
2. WHEN errors occur in API calls THEN the AI SHALL be able to help diagnose issues
3. WHEN forms are present THEN the AI SHALL be able to help with form completion
4. WHEN the page contains data tables THEN the AI SHALL be able to help analyze or extract data
5. WHEN the user is on specific types of pages THEN the AI SHALL offer contextually relevant workflows

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want a browser extension popup interface to control monitoring features, so that I can easily configure and manage the extension's behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking the extension icon in the browser toolbar THEN the system SHALL display a popup interface
2. WHEN the popup opens THEN the user SHALL see toggles for each monitoring feature (network monitoring, DOM tracking, context awareness)
3. WHEN the popup is displayed THEN the user SHALL have a master toggle to enable/disable the entire extension
4. WHEN toggling features THEN the changes SHALL take effect immediately on the current tab
5. WHEN the popup shows settings THEN the user SHALL see the current status of each monitoring feature
6. WHEN configuring privacy settings THEN the user SHALL be able to add domain exclusions from the popup
7. WHEN the extension is disabled THEN all monitoring SHALL stop and the Spotlight overlay SHALL be unavailable

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a plugin API for websites to integrate with the monitoring system, so that they can provide enhanced context and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the plugin API THEN websites SHALL be able to register context providers
2. WHEN context providers are registered THEN the system SHALL use them for enhanced data collection
3. WHEN websites provide semantic markup THEN the system SHALL automatically detect and utilize it
4. WHEN plugin integration is active THEN the system SHALL provide feedback to the website about monitoring status
5. WHEN multiple context providers exist THEN the system SHALL merge and prioritize the information appropriately
